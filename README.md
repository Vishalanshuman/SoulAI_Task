<h4>Assumptions:<h4/>
The text extracted from the PDF is clean and sufficient for classification.
The categories for classification are fixed (e.g., warranty, transactions, troubleshooting).
A machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes) or a rule-based approach can be used for classification.
The training dataset consists of labeled text data belonging to the given categories.
Solution:
Step-by-Step Approach:
Text Extraction:

Extract text from PDF documents using a library like PyPDF2.
Text Preprocessing:

Preprocess the text for classification (e.g., tokenization, removing stop words).
Model Training:

Train a machine learning model using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features and a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes) to classify text into categories.
Flask API:

Implement a Flask API that accepts PDF files, processes the text, and returns the classification result.
