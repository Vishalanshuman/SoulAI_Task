<h3>Assumptions:<h3/>
<p>The text extracted from the PDF is clean and sufficient for classification.
The categories for classification are fixed (e.g., warranty, transactions, troubleshooting).
A machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes) or a rule-based approach can be used for classification.
The training dataset consists of labeled text data belonging to the given categories.<p/>
<h3>Solution:<h3/>
<h2>Step-by-Step Approach:<h2>
<h2>Text Extraction:<h2/>

<p>Extract text from PDF documents using a library like PyPDF2.
Text Preprocessing:

Preprocess the text for classification (e.g., tokenization, removing stop words).
Model Training:

Train a machine learning model using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features and a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes) to classify text into categories.<p/>
<h2>Flask API:<h2>

<p>Implement a Flask API that accepts PDF files, processes the text, and returns the classification result.<p/>


<h2>Flask API:<h2/>

<p>A POST route /classify is defined to accept PDF documents.
The PDF is saved temporarily, and text is extracted using PyPDF2.
The extracted text is classified using a pre-trained model.<p/>
<h2>Machine Learning Model:<h2/>

<p>A simple Naive Bayes classifier is trained using TF-IDF vectorization.
The model is saved using joblib to load it during API runtime for classification.<p/>
<h2>Response:<h2>

<p>The API returns the category of the document (e.g., warranty, transaction) in JSON format.<p/>
